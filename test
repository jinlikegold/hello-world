        <h2 class="smaller-headings">A few glimpses into the life & work of this incredible human:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Jemisin was born on September 19th, 1972 (a Virgo sun with the moon in Aquarius! Unsurprising, then, that she grew up to pen fantastical works with meticulous language). </li>
          <li>She grew up in New York City and Mobile, Alabama. Her alma maters are Tulane University and the University of Maryland.</li>
          <li>Earlier in her career, she also worked as a counseling psychologist and career counselor. In 2016, she ran a successful Patreon campaign to help fund her pivot to focusing on writing full-time.</li>
          <li>Jemisin's writing is critically acclaimed not only for its extraordinary storytelling, but for its breathtaking, metaphorical portrayal of cultural conflict and systemic oppression.</li>
          <li>Some motifs that dance throughout her fiction are: earth-based magic, the enslavement / incarceration of immense godlike power, apocalypse, the centering of Black/Brown/Indigenous identities, and queer & polyamorous relationships.</li>
          <li>Her work is also notable for her unusual and skilled use of narration perspective, particularly second person. </li>
          <li>Jemisin was the first author to win the Hugo Award for Best Novel for all three books in her trilogy, <em>The Broken Earth</em>. </li>
          <li>In addition to her celebrated novels, she also published a short story collection, <em>How Long 'til Black Futures Month?</em> in November 2018.</li>
          <li>In 2020, she became a MacArthur Grant Fellow.</li>
          <li>Her first series, <em>The Inheritance Trilogy</em>, is slated to become a TV series, while <em>The Broken Earth Trilogy</em> will be adapted for film by Jemisin herself.</li>
          <li>Her latest book is <em>The City We Became</em>, an urban fantasy love letter to New York City and its boroughs.
